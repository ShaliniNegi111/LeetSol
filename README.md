# LeetSol

LeetSol is the compilation of solution to the problems on LeetCode. Most of the solutions are implemented using C++ but some are in C as well. All of these solutions have been tested with the LeetCode submission process. 

The aim of this repository is to be the single point for others users to compare their solutions against these. So, whenever you have a better solution in mind than the one implemented here, please feel free to request a submission for the same. However, your code must be properly indented with "astyle" default coding guidelines and it must be fully tested with LeetCode test cases. Improving the readibility of the code by adding comments is always appreciated and sought after.
